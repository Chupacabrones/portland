# Portland RPG - backstory attempt #1

## conflict: 
you, a newly rooted portlander, try to find your way into the inner rings of a complicated social system. why? because your brother, askkii, recently moved here as well, but you haven't heard from him in nearly 4 months.  in the last message he posted (to?), he mentioned discovering some kind of super-exclusive morning brunch pub and was trying to gain enough (influence?) in order to make it through the door on the one tuesday they were open each month. after that, he stopped posting and hasn't answered his phone. 

you decide to retrace his steps and go looking for him.  are you prepared for the social embarressments that await you? why was your brother so obsessed with these sorts of exclusive breakfast destinations? did he discover something so exclusive he could no longer participate in "normal" society? will you be endangered by following after him?  your mind will not rest until you have answers.


## subplot
there's a dark breakfast underworld beneath the city, soon to be discovered by a group of people, daring enough to find its entrance.  by making your way deep into this cavernous greasy underbelly, you hope not only to find your brother, but possibly find the true meaning of breakfast at tiffany's along the way.

# back story

you awaken, as you have for the last 100 days, trying to remember the path you were following from the previous day. your divided emotions create many tiny conflicts that you attempt to resolve 1-by-1.  unsure of any method to help you priotize the resolution of your thoughts, you quickly jump out of bed, deploying distraction, disengaging your subconcious and pulling yourself to the foreground.  

The cityscape always impresses your refreshed eyes as you begin finding food. Today may open up the necessary opportunity to gain access to a nearby 24-hour breakfast diner where you might find more answers to your brother's mysterious disappearance. along the way you'll need to interact with the right people and find a hat in order to get in.
